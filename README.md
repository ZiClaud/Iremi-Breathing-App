#### Breathing exercises:

Pranayama: This is a traditional yogic breathing technique that involves controlling the breath in
specific ways to promote physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. There are many different types
of pranayama, each with its own benefits.

Kapalbhati: This is a traditional yogic breathing technique that involves forceful exhalations
followed by passive inhalations. This technique is believed to stimulate the digestive system and
improve lung function.

Alternate nostril breathing: This technique involves breathing through one nostril at a time while
holding the other nostril closed with the fingers. This technique is believed to balance the energy
flow in the body and promote relaxation.

Buteyko breathing: This technique involves slowing down the breathing rate and reducing the volume
of each breath. It is often used to treat respiratory problems such as asthma and COPD.
